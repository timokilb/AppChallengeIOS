# Task:

You are building a Wikipedia Tool. Your colleague has already written a lot of code, but the project is not finished and contains a few mistakes. Sadly, he did not write any comments at all. First, fix the project so it compiles without errors. Then, finish the project!
When opening the app, the user can search for a term and get a list of at most 10 results displayed in a table view. If the user then clicks on one of these Cells, a WebView will open, loading the respective article.
If you are done, feel free to add some spice to your project. This can be anythink you like.
